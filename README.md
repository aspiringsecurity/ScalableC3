# Gamification of NFT Marketplace on Algorand (Game: Algorand Citizens)

Vision and Goals: Befriending Learning: Education by Gaming, Storytelling to onboard community members and build NFT marketplace on Algorand for Social Welfare

Abstract: We wish to also create an open source community game to onboard users, designers, curators and developers to NFT marketplace on Algorand. Matching community and environment incentives along with gamification is an engaging strategy for outreach, marketing and education and enable faster user onboarding.

We propose to improve upon the existing ways of imparting NFT education in Algorand eco-system by incorporating a fun-based learning game, Algorand Citizens, which is an open-source Web3 software activity. This game involves inculcating community leadership skills and removing the learning differences that might arise due to NFT users belonging to different age groups, ethnic backgrounds, cultures and economic backgrounds. Algorand Citizens involve optimization of resources of a town, while taking appropriate steps to ensure the common welfare. An NFT curriculum can further be integrated into the various tasks. Please find the design goals of the game attached in the document.

The 7 characters in our community game "Algorand Citizens" are (please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/ScalableC3/blob/main/Char%20jpegs.zip and download the game characters):
